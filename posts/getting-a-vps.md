I think many of you have thinked to get that VPS, but the prices are quite expensive, at least in Finland. 

There is a solution, get that VPS from Lithuania. Although, they have raised their prices, but it's still kind of cheap. 

Last summer, I came up with this idea, to build my own test website to see how Matomo works, if you're not familiar with Matomo, it's like a tracking cookie, like a Google Analytics, but more user and GDPR friendly. 

Check their current offers from here, [Time4vps](https://www.time4vps.com/).

You can see my test server [here](https://testi-pannu.net). I also run a bunch of services there, like Squid proxy server, Discord bots, React, MongoDB and also IRC-bounchers.
