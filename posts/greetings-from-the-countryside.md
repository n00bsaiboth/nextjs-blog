Greetings from the countryside!

It has been around 2-3 months now, that we have been living on the country side and soon it will be winter, so we do have alot of extra time on our hands. So if you need help with your website, server or computer. Feel free to contact us!

So what have we been up to:

- There is always something that we can do to our website and or our server. It was a bit of a struggle to get the email working, so we used plan c for that.
- We joined the omapaja, so with luck we get more visibility and with visibility, hopefully we get more assignments and work. Go check it out, [osaajia.omapaja.fi/openinnovations](https://osaajia.omapaja.fi/openinnovations).
- If you appreciate our work, you can now buy us a "virtual" coffee. [Buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/openinnovations)!

In the meantime, we keep ourselves busy. Actually few hours ago, we upgraded the PHP-version to 8.4 for our server and it caused some downtime, but atleast the [uptimerobot](https://uptimerobot.com) reacted quickly, although we knew that the site was down. It might need some further investigation, but atleast the site is up.
