React with ChatGPT!

This was more like a test, but you can run chatGPT with or inside your React application. All you need to do is to create an API Key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) and buy some credits or tokens, this will cost you around 10 US dollars.

Because it's not free to use, keep your API key hidden, for example you can use the .env file, and get the key from there.

Here is the source code for my little ChatGPT application or project.
