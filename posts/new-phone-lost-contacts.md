Hi,

We don’t usually change our smart phone very often, but now the old phone got pretty old, so we had to change it to new one. So, during the process, I made a some sort of bobo and lost some of the contacts that I have been added to my old phone, for the past 5 years.

The number is still the same, +358 41 701 6628. We don’t usually answer to unknown numbers, so feel free to submit your number before you try to call me, so I know to answer. Of course you can send me a message on Signal, Telegram, Discord, or WhatsApp, or then again, the old fashioned email. So I can call you back.
