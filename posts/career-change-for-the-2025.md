This year gave me a lot of thought, that who I want to be, when I grow up. I've been always playful when it comes to Linux, but I've been thinking that I should change the stack, I've been working with. LAMP is great, no questions asked, but we live in the year of 2024, so maybe I'll change it to be more like, MERN.

It's not also about the stack, like I said, I've been playful with Linux, so maybe I'm more like a devops guy, than a developer guy.
