This is me, thinking to myself (out loud).

This year gave me a lot of thought, that who I want to be, when I grow up. I've been always playful when it comes to Linux, but I've been thinking that I should change the stack, I've been working with. LAMP is great, no questions asked, but we live in the year of 2024, so maybe in the year of 2025, I'll lean more towards MERN stack.

I have a few node projects coming up, but they are not finished yet. Stay tuned and feel free to drop by at [GitHub](https://github.com/n00bsaiboth).

When talking about node or MERN stack. This year I've been trying to keep myself busy and self study from [fullstackopen](https://fullstackopen.com) and from [tieto.nurminen.dev](https://tieto.nurminen.dev/), but the studies are also still in progress. Still, you can see the live demo's here,

You might also know that I love to documentate and search for information. I've been doing my own documentation project to Jira's confluence for almost a year now, but with Jira, it's not so easy to make it public, so I decided to make it open with other CMS.

So I was pondering between the new Drupal [Starshot](https://www.drupal.org/about/starshot) and Wordpress. I was already going with Drupal, but then I got a change of heart and switched to Wordpress.

I have a Drupal history, so it was a bit of a shock, that there was no composer out of the box on Wordpress. Then the environment switching between develop and production was also a bit pain. Luckily, after a few days of Googling, I found [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/). Bedrock comes with other benefits too, the file structure is more clear and it works really well with Lando.

The documentation project can be viewed here, even though, it doesn't have much content yet.

Back to the main topic. It's not only about the stack, like I said, I've been playful with Linux, so maybe I'm more like a devops guy, than a developer guy. At least I know, that I'm not much of a front end guy.

Thanks for reading and I hope you a good year of 2025. While your at it, go buy yourself a coffee and offer one for me to at [buymeacoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/openinnovations).
