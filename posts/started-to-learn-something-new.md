First of all, I lied. I have some experience on MERN-stack, like I told. But that is not my strength, at least for now.

Because this is my first next.js app, this means, that there is still alot to learn. For example I had some troubles to add the social media icons on the front page footer section. Then again, I'm not quite sure if I imported the normalize.css in the right way.

But I think it's nice to learn new things and I think this will be a whole new adventure to web-development.
