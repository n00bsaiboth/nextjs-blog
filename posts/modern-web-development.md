## What is modern web development?

If you are interested in modern web development (docker, node, mongodb, etc) and want to learn more, I have news for you, because there are few good tutorials online that can help you.

The first one is [fullstackopen](https://fullstackopen.com) . You can see our live demo [here](https://develop.openinnovations.io). Although, it's still work in progress.

The second one is [tieto.nurminen.dev](https://tieto.nurminen.dev) . Also for this one, we have live demo available till the end of february. It's more or less finished, so check it out [here](https://virtual-server.openinnovations.io).
