Some of you might not even know that we moved to country side, like a few weeks ago. Just a bus trip away from Turku, so it's like an hour away from Turku. So it's really easy to get back to Turku and back to the country side.

Few days ago, it was a rainy day or rainy days, so we refreshed our memory and decided to try to run a MERN stack on Apache web server. The site itself is not mind blowing, but now we know that it's possible to run MERN on Apache. This might not be the best option to do this, but it's possible and there is a few things to remember, when you run your application, site or service on Apache and or production. If you have any questions, feel free to ask or contact me.
