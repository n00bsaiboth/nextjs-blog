Hi,

I'm happy to announce that my search for job is over. I'm currently working at Citrus as a Drupal-developer.

What this means, is that I can't work as a web developer as my spare time, but I can work as an consultant.

You can view my LinkedIn profile from [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jussi-k-jokinen/).
