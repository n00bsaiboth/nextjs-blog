## Welcome and here is our upcoming and ongoing documentation project

As many of you might already know that we like to do documentation quite a lot. So almost for the past year, we have done on our own documentation to Jira's Confluence.

Confluence is a good place to keep your documentation, but if you want to share your documentation, then it's a bit of an issue.

This is an ongoing project, because at the moment we still keep a lot of our documentation on Confluence and also update it, but we desided to create an open version of it. So there is a web site, built with Wordpress (note: that it wasn't an easy case to choose between Wordpress and Drupal).

The documentation doesn't aim to be perfect, because it's mostly based on our experience, like what worked for us, might not work for you. Also the topics are from our interests, so there is a big chance that you don't find the topic you are looking for, because it's not in our scope.

You can drop by at anytime at [documentation.openinnovations.io](https://documentation.openinnovations.io).
