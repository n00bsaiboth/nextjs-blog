About a month ago we told you about [Pi network](https://minepi.com) and it's not too late to start mining. Feel free to join our mining team at [n00bsaiboth at Pi networks](https://minepi.com/n00bsaiboth). As you can see the price is still the same, so it's more or less stable, at the moment. You can see the current market value [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pinetwork/).

As Pi Network seems to be quite stable and reliable token at the moment, but wait there is more.

I haven't yet googled these out, so they might not be as stable or reliable as Pi Network and might even be a scam, but you never know.

For starters I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of Telegram, but these miners work on Telegram. So it's necessary to use it. Here are some invitations.

- [Hot Wallet](https://t.me/herewalletbot/app?startapp=16374163)
- [Hamster Kombat](https://t.me/hamster_kombaT_bot/start?startapp=kentId6292274138)
- [TapSwap](https://t.me/tapswap_mirror_1_bot?start=r_6292274138)
- [MemeFi Coin](https://t.me/memefi_coin_bot?start=r_4778a7995f)

What I've noticed so far, that Telegram tokens are more or less like a wild west. New tokens are popping up like mushrooms on the autumn rain. So it gets easily confusing and the chance of getting scammed rises. So my advice to you is that check that the token has a community behind it, check the montly users, the more users, the better. Finally check that the token is verified by Telegram (blue badge after the bot or group name). Remember after all this, there is a still chance that you get scammed one way or the other.

Also keep in mind that these Telegram tokens are usually NOT or TON, so the value or price is much more lower than Pi token. [TON value is around 5 USD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/toncoin/) and [NOT value is around 0.007 USD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/notcoin/).

Like I told I haven't investigated the above tokens so far, but please let me know what you think about those.
