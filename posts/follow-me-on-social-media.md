Like I told on the previous post, I'm new to next.js so I had some troubles to add the social media icons from the font-awesome library. The plan was to make them visible on the front page footer section, but because that didn't work, I did it the old fashioned way.

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jussi-k-jokinen/)
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/n00bsaiboth/)
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/n00bsaiboth/)
- [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/n00bsaiboth/)
- [GitHub](https://www.github.com/n00bsaiboth/)

Also, you can view my personal homepages from [here](http://jussi.jokinen.arkku.net) and my light entrepreneur pages from [here](https://openinnovations.io). Although, it has been quite quiet on the business side.

That's why I'm looking for a "stable" developer position, near Turku area, with a salary wish of 15-30 euros/hour, because I think it's reasonable salary wish for a guy like me.

Edit: At the moment, I'm refactoring the code for openinnovations. The idea is that we have a light content management system on it. In the meanwhile or in the meantime, you can follow us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/4X9hDCG6A4) and or via [Slack](https://openinnovations-group.slack.com/archives/C06TDQBDA7P). You can also follow us on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/fi.open.innovations) and see our another [blog](https://nextjs-blog-seven-rho-68.vercel.app/).

Feel free to join and follow us, and for like future work, I'm not doing anything free and I hope that you use channels like, Discord or Slack to contact me, if it's about work.

Now you can find us also on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/openinnovations/).

Also you might notice that on some of the sites, we use matomo to collect the visitor data. You don't need to worry, because it's only the visitor data we are after.
