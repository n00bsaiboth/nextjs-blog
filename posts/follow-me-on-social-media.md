Like I told on the previous post, I'm new to next.js so I had some troubles to add the social media icons from the font-awesome library. The plan was to make them visible on the front page footer section, but because that didn't work, I did it the old fashioned way.

- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/n00bsaiboth/)
- [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/n00bsaiboth/)
- [GitHub](https://www.github.com/n00bsaiboth/)

Also, you can view my personal homepages from [here](http://jussi.jokinen.arkku.net) and my light entrepreneur pages from [here](https://infected-design.net). Although, it has been quite quiet on the business side. 

That's why I'm looking for a "stable" developer position, near Turku area, with a salary wish of 9-11 euros/hour, because I think it's reasonable salary wish for a guy like me.
