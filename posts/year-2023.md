There has been plenty of things going on, but what about my future. Well, I've been thinking to finish up my studies at the Turku University of Applied Sciences. Then go even dever and get some knowledge on information security, maybe JS, like react and so on.

But every day, I want to be a better man, that I was yesterday.
