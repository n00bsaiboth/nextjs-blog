Hi,

As far as anyone knows and if you didn’t know already, now you know.

I or we mostly speak only ATK, so people and smart phones can be tricky for me or us. Don’t get me wrong, because I’m speaking for our Light entrepreneur company, we, us, me and I get confused all the time. So basically I’m speaking for openinnovations.io, all the time.

Now that, that has been said, I don’t usually change my phone often, but now my old phone got pretty old, so I had to changed it to new one. So, during the process, I made a bobo and lost all the contacts that I have been added to my old phone, for the past 5 years.

So if you have something to say to me (or us), the number is still the same, familiar, +358 41 701 6628. So feel free to submit your number before you try to call me and tell me who you are. So I know to answer. If the phone number is unkown or just a number, I will not answer you or the calls that I'm not suspecting to be having. So if it’s urgent and important, send me a message on Signal, Telegram, Discord, or WhatsApp, or then again, the old fashioned email. So I can call you back.
